  FORM
    Idealized secondary structure lattice representation of a protein structure.
    FORMS describe a layered topology in which each layer is composed of a defined number of either alpha-helices or hydrogen-bonded beta-strands.
    This compressed definition of the protein space was firstly introduced by Tylor and collaborators :cite:`taylor2002periodic`,
    :cite:`taylor2008prediction`.
